32 1 1      ! Number of events and max and min iterations
0.000001    ! Accuracy (ignored because max iterations = min iterations)
0           ! Grid Adjustment 0=none, 2=adjust (NB if = 0, ftn26 will still be used if present)
1           ! Suppress Amplitude 1=yes (i.e. use MadEvent single-diagram enhancement)
0           ! Helicity Sum/event 0=exact
1           ! Channel number for single-diagram enhancement multi-channel
