*** (3) Compare GMADEVENT_CUDACPP x100 xsec to MADEVENT xsec ***

OK! xsec from fortran (46.837442861749352) and cpp (46.837442861749352) differ by less than 2E-14 (0.0)

*** (3) Compare GMADEVENT_CUDACPP x100 events.lhe to MADEVENT events.lhe reference (with dummy colors and helicities) ***

OK! events.lhe.cuda.100 and events.lhe.ref.100 are identical
