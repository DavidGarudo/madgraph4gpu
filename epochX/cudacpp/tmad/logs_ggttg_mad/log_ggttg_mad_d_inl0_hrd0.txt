OK! xsec from fortran (7.9292198506014475E-002) and cpp (7.9292198506014502E-002) differ by less than 2E-14 (4.440892098500626e-16)

*** (3) Compare GMADEVENT_CUDACPP x100 events.lhe to MADEVENT events.lhe reference (with dummy colors and helicities) ***

OK! events.lhe.cuda.100 and events.lhe.ref.100 are identical
